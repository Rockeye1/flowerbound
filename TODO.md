- The stim roller is good
- the meter is a bit odd
  - I would have designed a persona card that's a slim little card with plus minus for meters
- I think I'd like a button that just rolls a d10 for generic checks

an auto-end-turner might be nice
pop the sensitivity and arousal and satiation or w/e
